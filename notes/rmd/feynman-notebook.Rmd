### issue - GFSM 2014 Fiscal variables

Can the compilation of fiscal variables in accordance with the GFSM2014 be considered one of the aims of the dissertation? Is this a valid academic objective?

I was in touch with the researcher who is leading the publication of GFS for the Brazilian government and they do not intend to publish detailed information for individual SGNs.

% In order to better grasp the problems related to the comprehensiveness and quality of the data, a few details of the evolution of the Brazilian fiscal reporting system are of great assistance.  However 

% Relevant events

% - MP n. 434 1994-02-27
% - Fiscal Responsibility Law 2000-05-04
% - Change of Economic Classification 2001-05-04
% - Information Systems

% Dimensions

% - Currency
% - Real vs Nominal
% - Stock vs Flow variables
% - Accrual vs Cash

% - Why market data is not relevant in this case (see risk octagon and nota tecnica STN)

### issue - Aims/Objectives of the Study

% Payment Capacity Evaluation Methodology (CAPAG) used by the National Treasury Secretariat (STN) to assess the solvency of subnational governments in Brazil, both states and municipalities, in borrowing operations where the federal government needs to provide debt guarantees for the creditors.

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item to assess the extent to which analytical instruments commonly used for risk management in the financial sector can fruitfly be employed in the public sector for the management of fiscal risks originating from contigent liabilities that arises from intergovernmental fiscal relations;
% \item to identify financial ratios/fiscal indicators relevant for the analysis of fiscal sustainability that take into account 
%   \begin{enumerate}
%   \item the specificities of the public sector as opposed to the private sector
%   \item the characteristics of subnational governments as opposed to national governments
%   \end{enumerate}
% \item to employ econometric techniques that are able to address the more relevant statistical characteristics of the problems, namely, 
% \end{enumerate}

### issue - Definition of fiscal sustainability

I've put a section on fiscal sustainability in the outline, but how much should I actually pursuit there.

- debt sustainability or solvency - government’s ability to service its debt obligations without explicitly defaulting on them

- fiscal sustainability - government’s ability to indefinitely maintain the same set of policies while remaining solvent

### issue - What to do if things go wrong

### issue - Timeline

- Prefer to receive a full draft or drafts of specific chapters?
- Two weeks out and hope to finish by the end of August which gives 10 weeks roughly

### issue - Statistical characteristics of fiscal crisis

% \item the fact that default and debt reestructuring episodes are rare events
% \item the fact that default risks are positively correlated
% \item the fact that equating debt reestructuring, default, and debt relief episodes create possibilities of misclassified outcomes
% \item the decision-theorethic nature of the problem faced by the National Treasury Secretariat
% \item the importance of incorporating non-statistical information in the assessment of fiscal sustainability
% \item the strong multicolinearity expected between the explanatory variables owing to the nature of the financial ratios/fiscal indicators
% \item the panel structure of the dataset
