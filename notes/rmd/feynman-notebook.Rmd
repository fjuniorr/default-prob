### issue - GFSM 2014 Fiscal variables

Can the compilation of fiscal variables in accordance with the GFSM2014 be considered one of the aims of the dissertation? Is this a valid academic objective?

I was in touch with the researcher who is leading the publication of GFS for the Brazilian government and they do not intend to publish detailed information for individual SGNs.

Relevant events

- MP n. 434 1994-02-27
- Fiscal Responsibility Law 2000-05-04
- Change of Economic Classification 2001-05-04
- Information Systems

Dimensions

- Currency
- Real vs Nominal
- Stock vs Flow
- Accrual vs Cash

Market data is not relevant in this case (see risk octagon and nota tecnica STN)

### issue - Aims/Objectives of the Study

The Payment Capacity Evaluation Methodology (CAPAG) used by the National Treasury Secretariat (STN) to assess the solvency of subnational governments in Brazil, both states and municipalities, in borrowing operations where the federal government needs to provide debt guarantees for the creditors.

My aim could be either to

- assess the payment capacity methodology used by STN
- propose a payment capacity methodology

If it is the second, then the following becomes important

- to assess the extent to which analytical instruments commonly used for risk management in the financial sector can fruitfly be employed in the public sector for the management of fiscal risks originating from contigent liabilities that arises from intergovernmental fiscal relations;
- to identify financial ratios/fiscal indicators relevant for the analysis of fiscal sustainability that take into account 
    - the specificities of the public sector as opposed to the private sector
    - the characteristics of subnational governments as opposed to national governments
- to identify other explanatory variables relevant for the case at hand

### issue - Statistical characteristics of fiscal crisis

Ideally, the econometric techniques should be able to address or/and take advantage od the more relevant statistical characteristics of the problems, namely

1. the fact that default and debt reestructuring episodes are rare events (rare events)
2. the fact that the disturbances are most likely correlated between states (?)
3. the fact that defining and identifiyng the event of interest (debt reestructuring, default, and debt relief episodes) create possibilities of misclassified outcomes (error in variables)
4. the fact that the dependent variable might be better defined as not binary (ordered logit)
5. the panel structure of the dataset (fixed effect logit)
6. the strong multicolinearity expected between the explanatory variables owing to the nature of the financial ratios/fiscal indicators (factor analysis)
7. the importance of incorporating non-statistical information in the assessment of fiscal sustainability (bayesian analysis)
8. the decision-theorethic nature of the problem faced by the National Treasury Secretariat since the loss function depends on the size of the guarantee (bayesian analysis)
