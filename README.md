Assessing Default Probabilities in Subnational Governments: The Case of Brazil
===

The increasing decentralization for the delivery of public services for local governments coupled with the fiscal crisis that several countries are facing for the last several years makes a clear case for the necessity to better understand the fiscal institutions that govern the fiscal relations in federations.

In Brazil, the institutional design choosen was that of a contractual approach. The national government must give permission for subnational governments to borrow more debt. This is clearly a statistical decision problem.

The fitted values of the credit scoring model will give the evolution of default probabilities across time. With that information, it's possible to assess the the impact of other events (eg. entitlements and earmarking) in the evolution of the default probabilities.

Use confirmatory factor analysis to build factors for fiscal indicators (fiscal flexbibility, liquidity, etc)
